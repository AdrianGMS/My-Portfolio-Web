<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr/>
<ul>
    <li><h2>Do exercise</h2></li>
    <p>I've always loved to be in shape, I love to train because it helps to get out all 
        the stress after a heavy and hard day.  It helps to release energy and dopamine, 
        the hormone of hapiness. It also helps maintain a healthy lifestyle. I train 4
        hours a week and it helps me keep my mind clear and relax.

    <li><h2>Playing videogames</h2></li>
    <p>I am a big fan of video games, I've played them since I was a kid. I love from
    online competitive games to history single player mode. I love a good story but 
    also a good challenge so that victory feel rewarding. I think videogames are like 
    movies you interact with and you learn from. You can learn new places, new things and 
    embrace yourself in a world of fantasy for a few houws.</p>
    <li><h2>Playing guitar and singing</h2></li>
    <p>I love music. When there is a song i feel like I can be able to play it in guitar
    and sing it I search for a tutorial on YouTube and practice it to learn it. I 
    dont know how to play guitar in my opinion, I  just watch how   the fingers are 
    placed and do the same. I love to play and sing to my girlfriend and for myself.
